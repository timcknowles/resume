Knowles T, Scott G, Southgate E & Wyatt J. Clinicians who Code: Submitted to the BMJ and awaiting reviewers decision. An analysis of the urgent need for junior clinical leadership in NHS health IT.



Automation bias within electronic prescribing decision support systems (DSS): An ongoing randomised control study (www.eprescribingresearch.com). I conceived the study, acted as primary investigator during my 4-month academic F2 placement and secured funding from Imperial Biomedical Research Centre.

Observations Research– In collaboration with a colleague, I built an online tool http://observationsresearch.appspot.com/ that utilises choice-based conjoint analysis to investigate which observation parameters are most valued by clinicians in prioritising care of unwell patients. We anticipate this will inform patient-risk scoring systems, by untangling the complex “gut feeling” of clinical assessment from physiological trends.
